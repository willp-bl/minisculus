# Team Challenges / Learning Sessions

Here are series of coding challenges that can be used as group exercises.  They facilitate team working, and promote
discussing/learning language features.

## How

We complete these challenges in a mob programming style - with everyone sat around a projector, everyone taking a turn
to be in the active pair of Driver (at the keyboard) / Chief Navigator (directing the Driver).  At the end of a time
period, say 5 minutes, the Navigator becomes the Driver and a new Navigator takes over.  The rest of the team can give
input, but not when the tests are red.

Challenges are completed using TDD - (red -> green -> refactor)

## Languages / Code

We use various languages for the challenges (Ruby, Java, ...)

Code is within each challenge's directory to provide what teams will need to start working on the challenges straight
away.
