1. What is Docker?
2. App vs VM vs Container
3. 12-factor
4. One to Lots
5. Practical

# What is Docker?

"Docker is the world’s leading software containerization platform" -
https://www.docker.com

"Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem
that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools,
system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. This
guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of
its environment." - https://www.docker.com/what-docker

---

# App vs [VM vs Container](https://www.docker.com/what-docker#/VM)

# Container == App + [some] Ops

---

# [12-factor](https://12factor.net/)

-> Read it

## Interesting factors relevant to this intro:

4: Config in the environment

6: Stateless processes

7: Port binding

8: Scale out

9: Disposability (fast to start, graceful shutdown)

10: Dev/prod parity

---

# One to Lots

Does it matter where the containers run?

Can compose whole services using `docker-compose.yml`:

* networking between microservices from within Docker
* auto load balancing

---

# Practical

Have a look at [README.md](https://github.com/willp-bl/team-challenges/tree/master/5_docker)
